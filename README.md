# [Unobtrusive Effects](https://modrinth.com/mod/unobtrusive-effects)
A small client-side Minecraft mod for Fabric that disables or lessens certain obtrusive visual effects.

### Features:
* Hides the first-person fire overlay while the Fire Resistance status effect is active.
* Culls the potion swirl particles while in first-person view within a specified distance.
* All features are optional.

### Configuration:
Either edit the config file (`unobtrusive-effects.ini`) found in the Fabric config folder (requires a restart for the changes to take effect), or (optionally) use [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to edit the options in game.
